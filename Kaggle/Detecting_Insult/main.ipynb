    "In this article, we consider the problem of detecting insults in social media comments. This is an important problem from a practical point of views since there are many social media sites such as youtube, yelp, etc, that are interested in detecting and filtering out comments that involve insults especially to other users. We use the data provided in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary) competition hosted by Kaggle. We follow the same setup and use the same performance criterion as in the competition to be able to compare our results to the winners of the competition."

That way she can look at their page if she feels like it but she won't be seeing more than she really wants to know. \\n\\nI have to agree though that writing about awesome presents you received or how much you really love, love, love your awesome BF, or telling everyone about your Valentines plans - seems a little like what CH called over sharing.  I guess because it's not the kind of the info that I would think about announcing.  For example, if my husband gives me an awesome gift - I don't rush to the phone to call everyone I know and tell them or even do a mass email to let everyone know.  Same with plans for special occasions.  \\n\\nIf someone asks me - then of course I'll tell them.

In this approach, first a bag-of-word representation of the documents is build which contains all the words that appear in any of the documents. Then the number of times each word appears in a document is calculated and is used as a feature vector to represent the document. Optionally, we can divide the word counts by the frequency of each word appearing in all the documents combine. This allows us to reduce the effect of very common words which do not convey much information. A detailed explanation of text vectorization techniques can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html)."

But if turn to the private leaderboard of the competition, we find that the best score was [0.84248](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary/leaderboard). This means that we have achieved more than 97% of the winning solution score which is great specially considering that we used logistic regression which is not considered a complex classifier. On the plus side however, logistic regression is very fast and efficient which is advantagous when using the model on real world data to classify comments as they are received."
