Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this 
first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your 
findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on 
how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where 
necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be 
required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, 
you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting 
and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact
for you reviewer.

+--------+--------------+		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
select avg
(
(review_count - (select avg(review_count) from user))*
(review_count - (select avg(review_count) from user))
) as var_review_count
from user

+------------------+
| var_review_count |
+------------------+
|    5620.33379975 |
+------------------+


select avg
(
(fans - (select avg(fans) from user))*
(fans - (select avg(fans) from user))
) as var_fans
from user

+--------------+
|     var_fans |
+--------------+
| 112.80909184 |
+--------------+


select avg
(
(fans - (select avg(fans) from user))*
(review_count - (select avg(review_count) from user))
) as covar
from user

+-------------+
|       covar |
+-------------+
| 526.4554648 |
+-------------+


correlation between fans and review_count:

corr = covar /(var_review_count * var_fans)^.5
= 526.4554648/(5620.33379975 * 112.80909184)^.5
= 0.661163
	

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	
There are more reviews with the word "love".

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

/*  Number of reviews with the word "love" */
select count(*) as cnt
from review
where lower(review.text) like "%love%" 

+------+
|  cnt |
+------+
| 1780 |
+------+

	
/*  Number of reviews with the word "hate" */
select count(*) as cnt
from review
where lower(review.text) like "%hate%" 

+-----+
| cnt |
+-----+
| 232 |
+-----+
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select id, name, fans
from user
order by fans desc
limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
+------------------------+-----------+------+

+------------------------+-----------+------+

	
11. Is there a strong correlation between having a high number of fans and being listed 
	as "useful" or "funny?"
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	

select useful_or_funny, avg(fans) as avg_fans
from (
select id, name, fans, useful, funny, (useful > (select avg(useful) from user)) | (funny > (select avg(funny) from user)) as useful_or_funny
from user
)
group by useful_or_funny
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+-----------------+---------------+
| useful_or_funny |      avg_fans |
+-----------------+---------------+
|               0 | 0.53328362978 |
|               1 | 16.1849427169 |
+-----------------+---------------+	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
We devide the users to two groups based on whether they are "useful or funny" or otherwise. To do this we use a subquery to calculate useful_or_funny
attribute, which is one when a user is more userful that the average user or more funny than the average user. Then we group the user based on
the useful_or_funny attribute and calculate the average number of fans for each group. The result suggest that there is a strong correlation. A user that
is useful or funny is likely to have a higher number of fans than a user than is not useful or funny.	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. 	Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city
	or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to 
	the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	
	i.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	
	
	ii.	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	
We group the businesses in city of "Las Vegas" to two groups based on whether the review score is above 2.5 (high_start).
Then we group by high_star and calculate the average review count. We see a substantial difference between
the average review counts in the two groups.

select high_star, avg(review_count)
from (
select *, stars > 2.5 as high_star
from business
where city = "Las Vegas" and state = "NV"
)
group by high_star

+-----------+-------------------+
| high_star | avg(review_count) |
+-----------+-------------------+
|         0 |     30.0856031128 |
|         1 |     57.6508058327 |
+-----------+-------------------+

	
	iii.	Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two
		groups? Explain.

No substantial difference is observed between the average location (latitude, langitude) of the businesses
for high star and low star groups.

select high_star, avg(review_count), avg(latitude), avg(longitude)
from (
select *, stars > 2.5 as high_star
from business
where city = "Las Vegas" and state = "NV"
)
group by high_star

+-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------------+
| high_star | avg(review_count) | avg(latitude) | avg(longitude) |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------------+
|         0 |     30.0856031128 | 36.1351105058 | -115.180774319 |
|         1 |     57.6508058327 | 36.1283465081 | -115.203161167 |
+-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------------+



	SQL code used for analysis:

Code is shown above for each part of the question.
		
		
2.	Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What
	differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are
	closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your
	answer.


select  is_open, avg(stars), avg(review_count), count(*)
from business
where city = "Las Vegas" and state = "NV"
group by is_open

+---------+---------------+-------------------+----------+
| is_open |    avg(stars) | avg(review_count) | count(*) |
+---------+---------------+-------------------+----------+
|       0 |           3.5 |             42.36 |      250 |
|       1 | 3.78893129771 |     55.1610687023 |     1310 |
+---------+---------------+-------------------+----------+
		
	i. 	Difference 1:
The number of open businesses is much larger than the closed ones.	
	
	ii.	Difference 2:
Average review count and stars are higher for open businesses.
	
	
	
	SQL code used for analysis:

Code is shown above.
	
3. 	For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you
	want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
	Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment 
	analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
	predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a 
	user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel 
	free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide
	answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
	i. 	Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
Predict the number of stars for a business based on business information and the text of reviews.
	
	ii.	Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis
		and why you chose that data:
			
We need to join the business table with the review table based on business id. In the resulting table
we select the columns that are most suitable for prediction of the number of stars for a business. These
columns are city, state, review_count, is_open, and review text. To be able to show the results properly, 
we only select the first 100 characters in each review.
		
	iii.	Output of your finished dataset:
